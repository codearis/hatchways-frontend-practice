# What are we looking for?

### Correctness

- Passes all of our tests, and shows great attention to detail
- Goes above and beyond the requirements, such as handling validation of improper inputs, or completing bonus
  requirements and stretch goals (like deploying an application).

### Code Organization, Readability & Maintainability

- Code utilizes a consistent design pattern. The code is well organized and would be easy to extend. Design made
  with consideration to potential future features.
- Code is easy to read - proper indentation, vertical spacing, named constants (no magic numbers), big picture
  comments, and meaningful variable names. You can investigate using a linter to help make your code properly
  formatted.
- There are small amounts of repeated code, and is well factored into functions. Related items are grouped into
  classes (or something equivalent like structs or objects).

### Code Performance - Efficiency, Data Structures & Algorithms

- Code that is performant (has a good time and space complexity for the problem given). Avoids unnecessary nested
  for loops, and uses the appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Efficient code that reduces unnecessary code.
- Implements additional features to improve code performance such as (but not limited to) caching, parallel API
  requests, reducing re-rendering on the front-end, memoization, and other code performance techniques.

### Best Practices & Proficiency in Language/ Framework

- Utilizes great programming practices such proper unit testing, reduced warnings, and defensive coding strategies
  (validation, asserts).
- Demonstrate a good grasp of the language and/or framework. Avoids major anti-patterns in the project (using let vs.
  const in Javascript, modifying the DOM in React, etc.)
- Utilizes the most advanced features in the framework (for example using functional components, Hooks in React).
- Properly replicates the styling spec provided, for a front end assessment.
