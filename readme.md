## Weather App

Live demo: https://codearis-weather-app.vercel.app/

This project was built following an asssessment for Hatchways - Frontend Practice Project, where the goal was to replicate the frontend application provided (as close as
possible). It was allowed to use any frontend framework (React.js, Vue.js, etc.) or use
plain Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

The finished application should look like this:

### How this assessment was approached

Since the application request was simple with hard coded values, I decided to expand it promoting a better user experience with dynamic values, using the same tools provided with a personal touch. These are the results:

You can also check a live demo in the link below (if the application won't work the number of requests reached the limit for the free plan)
